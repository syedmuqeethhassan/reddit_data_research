  "ai_response": "Based on the provided text, major potential problems when buying a used Lexus LS430 include:\n\n* **High maintenance costs:**  While known for reliability,  repair and maintenance costs can be substantial, especially for older models requiring parts replacement due to age (e.g., rubber front end parts).  Regular fluid changes are also important and add to the cost.\n\n* **Issues related to age and lack of maintenance:** Problems can arise from insufficient or neglected maintenance, such as a missed timing belt change.  Check the Carfax or service records carefully for evidence of timely maintenance.  Oil burning (indicated by white smoke on a cold start) is another potential issue to watch out for.\n\n* **Interior issues:**  Sun exposure can damage the interior, especially in cars not consistently garaged.\n\n  The provided text also mentions that while the LS430 is generally reliable,  older models (20+ years old) will require more maintenance than newer vehicles.  Additionally, one commenter suggests checking for rust."
