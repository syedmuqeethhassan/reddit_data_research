  "ai_response": "Based on the provided Reddit discussions, common problems to look out for when buying a Lexus LS430 include:\n\n* **Rust:**  Check carefully for rust, especially body rust, as this is a significant issue that can affect the car's structural integrity.\n\n* **Timing Belt:**  This is a major, costly repair if not done recently. Check for a sticker indicating when the timing belt was last replaced.\n\n* **100k Service:**  Inquire about whether the 100,000-mile service was performed.  This service typically includes items like timing belt, water pump, spark plugs, and fluid changes.  Negotiate a lower price if this service has not been completed.\n\n* **Maintenance History:** A complete and transparent maintenance history is crucial.  A lack of records or unclear repair information should raise concerns.  A pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic is highly recommended.\n\n* **Gas Mileage:** Be prepared for relatively lower gas mileage compared to more modern vehicles.\n\n\nWhile the LS430 is known for its reliability, it's important to remember that it's an older car and will require more maintenance than a newer vehicle.  A thorough inspection is essential before purchase."
