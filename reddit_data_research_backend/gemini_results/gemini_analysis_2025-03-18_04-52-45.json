  "analysis": "Based on the provided Reddit threads, here's what to consider before buying a used Lexus:\n\n**Reliability:** While Lexus has a reputation for reliability,  no car is immune to problems.  Even a Lexus will require maintenance (brakes, tires, etc.) over 10-20 years. The poster's initial assumption that a Lexus \"won't ever break\" is inaccurate.  Older models might be more mechanically simple and therefore potentially less prone to issues than newer, more technologically advanced ones.\n\n**Maintenance Costs:** Lexus maintenance, especially at dealerships, can be significantly more expensive than for comparable non-luxury brands like Toyota or Honda.  Factor this into your long-term ownership costs.  Consider finding a reputable independent mechanic specializing in Lexus vehicles to save on maintenance.\n\n**Resale Value:**  The original poster's wife emphasizes resale value.  However, if you plan to keep the car for 10-20 years, resale value is largely irrelevant.  The initial depreciation hit will be significant, regardless of the brand.\n\n**Theft:**  Some Lexus models, particularly those from 2017 and newer, are reportedly more susceptible to theft due to vulnerabilities in their CANBUS system. Research the specific model year and model you are considering to assess theft risk in your area.\n\n**Driving Experience:**  The original poster highlights a preference for simpler, less \"fancy\" cars due to their driving characteristics.  Test drive the specific used Lexus model thoroughly before committing to a purchase. Consider if the driving experience aligns with your preferences.\n\n\n**Recommendations from the thread:**\n\nMany commenters suggest considering Toyota models as a more affordable alternative. They share much of the same reliability and underlying mechanics as Lexus vehicles, without the premium price tag.  Several also mention Mazda as a good compromise between reliability and a more engaging driving experience.  Used Lexus models, particularly those a few years old and past the initial steep depreciation curve, are also frequently suggested as a cost-effective way to get into a used Lexus.\n\n**Before buying ANY used vehicle:**\n\n* **Get a pre-purchase inspection (PPI):** This is crucial for identifying potential mechanical issues before you buy.\n* **Check the vehicle history report (Carfax, AutoCheck):** Look for accidents, title issues, and maintenance records.\n* **Thoroughly inspect the vehicle:** Check for signs of wear and tear, damage, and any modifications that might affect reliability or value.\n* **Negotiate the price:**  Don't be afraid to haggle; used car prices can often be negotiated down.\n\n\nIn short, while a used Lexus might be a reliable choice, carefully weigh the long-term costs and driving experience against other, potentially more affordable options.  Don't let the \"luxury\" aspect cloud your judgment if the driving experience isn't for you.\n",
