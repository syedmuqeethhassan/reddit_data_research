  "analysis": "Based on the Reddit posts,  buying a used Lexus, specifically an RX 350, with around 115,000 miles is generally considered acceptable by many users,  especially when compared to other brands.  However, several crucial factors should be considered before purchasing:\n\n\n**1.  Maintenance History:** This is paramount.  Lexus/Toyota reliability is predicated on proper maintenance.  Demand complete service records.  A lack of records significantly increases the risk of hidden problems.  Even incomplete records are better than none\u2014they at least show some effort towards maintenance.\n\n**2. Pre-Purchase Inspection (PPI):**  Absolutely essential. Take the car to a trusted mechanic specializing in Lexus or Toyota vehicles for a thorough inspection. This will reveal any potential issues, big or small, that might not be immediately apparent. The cost of a PPI is a small price to pay compared to the cost of unexpected major repairs.\n\n**3. Vehicle History Report (Carfax):** Check the Carfax report for accident history, title issues (salvage, rebuilt), and odometer discrepancies.  A clean Carfax increases confidence in the car's condition.\n\n**4. Price Negotiation:**  While 115,000 miles is low for a Lexus, the price might still be high. Use the mileage and any potential issues revealed by the PPI as leverage to negotiate a lower price.  Many commenters suggest a price lower than the asking price is warranted.\n\n**5.  Specific Issues:** While Lexus/Toyota are known for reliability, even they have potential issues at higher mileages. Be aware of potential problems like:\n\n* **Transmission:**  Regular fluid changes are critical for long transmission life; check for evidence of this.\n* **Suspension Components:** Bushings and other suspension parts wear out, and replacing them can be costly.\n* **Oil Leaks:** Check for any signs of leaks, particularly around seals and gaskets.\n* **Electrical Systems:** Older cars can have electrical issues; have the mechanic thoroughly check these systems.\n* **Rust:** Inspect the undercarriage for rust, especially if the vehicle has been driven in a snowy or salty climate.  This is a significant factor affecting longevity and value.\n\n\n**6. Age and Technology:** A 2012 model will lack many modern safety features and infotainment systems.  Consider whether this is acceptable to you.  The comfort and reliability might outweigh the older tech for some.\n\n\nIn summary, buying a used Lexus with around 115,000 miles isn't inherently foolish, but it requires thorough due diligence.  Don't skip the PPI and Carfax report; they're critical in making an informed decision.  Use all information to negotiate a fair price.\n",
