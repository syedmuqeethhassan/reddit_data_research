  "analysis": "Based on the Reddit posts, several key factors should be considered before buying a used Lexus, particularly one with higher mileage:\n\n**1.  Mileage is Relative:**  While 115,000 miles might seem high to some, the consensus among Redditors is that this is relatively low for a Lexus, especially considering its age.  Lexus and Toyota vehicles are known for their reliability and longevity;  many users report driving their Lexuses well beyond 200,000 miles with minimal major issues. However, this assumes proper maintenance.\n\n**2. Maintenance History is Crucial:** The most important factor outweighing mileage is the car's maintenance history.  Thoroughly investigate this.  Look for:\n\n* **Service records:**  Demand detailed service records from the previous owner(s).  Regular oil changes and timely attention to other scheduled maintenance are paramount.  Missing records should raise red flags.\n* **Carfax report:** A Carfax report can provide valuable information about the vehicle's history, including accidents, title issues, and service records (though the latter may be incomplete).\n* **Pre-purchase inspection (PPI):**  Take the car to a trusted mechanic specializing in Lexus/Toyota vehicles for a thorough PPI. This is essential, regardless of the mileage or service history. The PPI should identify any potential problems before you buy.\n\n**3. Price Negotiation:** Use the mileage (even if low for a Lexus) as leverage to negotiate the price.  Many commenters suggest that the asking price might be slightly high for the mileage and age of the car, particularly if maintenance records aren't perfect.\n\n**4. Specific Potential Issues:**  While Lexuses are generally reliable, be aware of potential issues that can arise at higher mileages, even in Lexus vehicles:\n\n* **Transmission:**  Automatic transmission fluid changes are crucial for longevity and should be verified.\n* **Suspension components:**  Bushings, struts, and other suspension components can wear out over time, especially with higher mileage.  The PPI should check these.\n* **Other wear items:** Brakes, tires, belts, hoses are all wear items that will eventually need replacing regardless of brand and will cost money.\n* **Rust (particularly if it was in a region with salty winters):** Check for rust, especially underneath the car.\n\n**5.  Age:** Don't overlook the age of the vehicle.  A 2012 model, even a Lexus, will have older technology and may lack some safety features found in newer models (like backup cameras and advanced driver-assistance systems).  Weigh the benefits of higher reliability versus potentially outdated technology and safety features.\n\n\nIn summary: While the mileage on a used Lexus isn't necessarily a deal-breaker, a thorough examination of maintenance records, a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, and keen price negotiation are absolutely essential before making a purchase.\n",
