  "analysis": "Based on the provided Reddit threads, here's what to keep in mind when buying a used Lexus, particularly focusing on the concerns raised by the posters:\n\n**1. Mileage isn't everything (but maintenance is):**  While one poster considered 115,000 miles \"so many miles,\" many others emphasized that this is relatively low mileage for a Lexus, especially considering their reputation for longevity.  The key factor isn't the mileage itself, but the *maintenance history*.  Thoroughly examine service records (if available) or have a pre-purchase inspection done by a trusted mechanic specializing in Lexus vehicles. Look for evidence of regular oil changes, fluid flushes (especially transmission fluid), and timely repairs.\n\n**2.  Resale Value is irrelevant if you plan to keep it long-term:** Several commenters pointed out the contradiction of prioritizing resale value when intending to keep the car for 10-20 years.  If your goal is long-term ownership, focus on reliability and features that matter to *you*, not on potential future resale.\n\n**3.  \"It won't ever break\" is a myth:**  No car is immune to mechanical failure. Even Lexus vehicles require regular maintenance and will eventually need repairs.  While their reputation for reliability is well-deserved, understand that parts and service for a Lexus will generally be more expensive than for comparable non-luxury brands.\n\n**4.  Consider the total cost of ownership:** Don't just focus on the purchase price. Factor in insurance costs (which can be higher for luxury brands), fuel costs (some Lexus models require premium fuel), and the potential for more expensive repairs compared to non-luxury vehicles.  Assess if the long-term cost justifies the purchase, especially given your preference for less expensive cars.\n\n\n**5.  Negotiate the price:**  The Redditors suggest that the asking prices for some used Lexus models may be inflated due to their perceived reliability. Use the mileage and any potential maintenance needs uncovered during your inspection as leverage for negotiation.  Many posters suggest aiming for prices substantially lower than the initially listed price.\n\n**6.  Explore alternatives:** If the price of a used Lexus remains too high, explore other reliable brands like Toyota (Lexus' parent company) or Honda.  High-trim models from these manufacturers often offer similar features and comfort to entry-level luxury cars at a fraction of the cost.  Mazda is also frequently suggested as a good compromise between reliability and a more upscale driving experience.  Consider the Toyota Camry or Avalon,  which are often mentioned as being very similar to Lexus models in comfort and quality, but at a lower price point.\n\n\n**In short:** Don't let the Lexus badge cloud your judgment. A thorough pre-purchase inspection, a realistic assessment of the total cost of ownership, and a careful comparison with alternatives will help you make an informed decision that aligns with both your budget and your driving preferences.\n",
