      "selftext": "I've been driving a 2010 hyundai accent for the last 13 years. Brakes gave out and the repair costs aren't really worth it, especially because we were considering getting a new car for me this year anyway.\n\nMy preference is something on the smaller side. My top cars that we've test driven so far are honda civic + suburu impreza. Wife already has a civic so she's not really keen on that, plus she thinks it's over priced.\n\nFrom what she's said, her main concern is reliability because I'm likely to drive the car into the dirt over the next 10-20 years. After a conversation yesterday she's basically thrown out the idea of spending 25k on a car (impreza) and should just go for a lexus something for 50k because \"it won't ever break\" and generally has resell value.\n\nEvery single time I've driven anything even remotely fancy (I know accords aren't exactly fancy, but let's just say accord as a baseline), I just don't feel comfortable. The drive is just off to me. I then try the cheaper models and I'm like \"ya this!\".\n\nCollectively we make Something like 140k/yr before tax and other deductions. Can we afford it? Sure. Do I want to pay for it? Not if I like driving the cheaper car. Where I get stuck is I want this to be a team decision where both our inputs matter, and I'm not sure we've found something we could compromise on. I really don't want this to be a \"my way or the highway\" on either side.\n\nSmart car people, please help.\n\nUpdate: I did talk with my wife about just getting her a lexus and letting me take the civic. She said it wasn't about the civic but rather she just wants me to have something nice and new. Right in the feels. I think we've pretty well talked down from the lexus now so the wallet can breathe a little easier. Still have to figure out a car, but you all have had quite a few suggestions so we've got a pretty good list to try out. Also going to give the accord another chance later today.",

What I would figure out is how to reconcile these three points:\n* you are unwilling to maintain brakes on a 13yr old car that ostensibly still functions otherwise\n* you want a car that you can drive into the ground over 10-20 years\n* you are concerned with the resale value \n\nIf you like cheap cars, why not just keep the Hyundai? Any Lexus will need brakes several times over 20 years. If you drive it into the dirt, what does it matter what the resale value will be.",

She also feels it's not a particularly safe car. My guess to why that doesn't come up when looking at any car is that newer cars all have way more safety features in them by default. \n\nSo probably more of a trust issue in the Hyundai than anything else. Brakes are just the excuse to push me forward on a new car. It's probably also worth adding that we will have much more highway driving in the coming years due to moving, so that for sure plays a part when she's thinking about cars. The accent looks like a little death trap to her lol.",

I would avoid Subarus since they have cvt transmissions and more things to break with awd and just get a Honda or Toyota. For a newer car, probably a Toyota since Honda is using turbos in their newer vehicles which may not last the 10-15 years you want. Slightly less gas mileage and power than the equivalent Honda but Toyota stuck to basic engineering this generation.",

          "text": "Here is my take. Wife and I leased bmws for decades until the pandemic and they wanted a 10k markup on new bmws and 5k on used. Screw that. She got a 22 crosstrek, I got a 22 wrx and son got an Impreza 23. These cars are good. They have more road noise than the bmws and bmw has a much better electronic interface and better design and interior materials. But day to day, the Subarus are better. Msrp is about half and given that, the trade offs are acceptable. In fact, the wrx is better dynamically than all my prior bmw 3 series but one. \n\nHonda is adding 3k to all cars in markup or additional added crap that no one needs or wants. A dealer told me this is practically all US dealers. New civic is orob excellent but not at more than msrp.  \n\nLexus is known for reliability but my experience is the driving feel is minimal or non existent. And while it’s reliable, at some point it will require maintenance and things will wear out and need to be replaced. If you have extra money and can afford, then drive one and see. Otherwise, check Subaru. Imo, luxury cars are just that, a luxury item if you have extra disposable income. For bmw, you need a lot of cash for tires and when things break they are expensive if not covered by warranty.",

It’s contradictory to spend more for a car that holds its value - because realistically no car holds their value as well as you’d hope. A $45k Lexus ES will lose about 50% of its value(22500 ish) after 5 years. The retail market for 5 year old Lexus ES is in the mid 20k range, meaning trade in is usually lower. \n\nYou can buy a $28k civic and it may lose 60% value over the same period, but that 60% is 16800 not 22500. You would spend nearly $20k more upfront to lose 5k more down the road. \n\nAnd Lexuses aren’t any more bullet proof than the Toyota it’s based off of. Infact I would argue Lexuses are *more* prone to issues because they have more computers in them, more features to go bad. Toyota headunits can just be pulled out of the dash and replaced. Lexus uses a module, screen, and control switch. That’s 3x the probability of issues vs Toyotas where everything is built into 1 unit.\n\nWhat I would do is buy a well optioned Toyota",

Not always is high resale value the better value,  Often high resale value equates to higher initial purchase cost and the minimal improvement on resale value is not enough to offset the higher cost difference.  Therefore often a high resale car as a total dollar amount paid minus the lower value after 5 years is actually a higher loss of actual money.  Or even if an even sum dollar amount loss, you still paid more for the car.  The only cars I know that the high resale value pays off is Wrangler, Bronco, Tacoma and 4Runner.  Some of the Other American Trucks too a lesser extent like F150 and Ram 1500.  \n\nIf you want a Lexus then get a Lexus, but not for resale value or perceived reliability.  In my opinion based on your expressed economics it makes no sense at all to buy a more expensive car.  Too many really nice cars that fit your criteria.  Get a Honda, Toyota, Mazda, Ford etc.",

Moreover, the cars, depending on the year of manufacturing, can be a little funky in terms of the issues that arise. \n\nStill, they’re amazing cars. TDI and TSI engines will love the highway driving you’re anticipating.",

Try finding one with low miles that’s maybe 5 years old if you don’t mind not having CarPlay.  These were often bought by old folks, so they don’t get thrashed and probably sat in the garage most of the time. Another thing about Lexus: they need premium fuel. That’s a premium expense. I just bought a 2018 GX to replace a POS Nissan armada.  Gets better mileage, but that’s negated by the 25% premium price on fuel.  It’s a nice vehicle, but not significantly nicer than other Toyota offerings.  I would have bought a 4-runner, but their resale is insane.",

For the price, it's hard to have so much fun in a well built car that is even practical. \n\nIf it's just for me to enjoy, I would look at something like a BRZ.\n\nMy wife's had 3 Subarus and they have been good cars, especially if you have a real Winter. But her Miata was so much fun I was surprised it was legal. Well, things I did behind the wheel were definitely not legal...\n\nBetween my parents, wife, and me, we've had 2 Toyota trucks, 2 Lexus RXs, 2 4Runners, an old Odyssey, an MX5 (Miata), a Legacy Wagon, an Outback, and a Forester, and I have no complaints about any of them. Some were driven for many years, and we still have a few. I have had a Jeep I bought in 1998. It's been good, with a few major repairs and upgrades over 260k miles, but I don't trust the new ones to be that good, so I keep fixing stuff if it breaks.\n\nI don't mind \"luxury\" but I have never understood why I would care about luxury. I care how a seat feels, but I had a stripper 1987 Toyota pickup with a bench seat that was really comfortable, and a 1972 914 with rudimentary fiberglass seats with a little padding, that were the most comfortable seats I've ever sat in for a long time (24 hours straight, once). I've sat in really \"luxurious\" plush seats that were uber-power-adjustable, and I couldn't find any way to adjust them that didn't make my back hurt after an hour. \n\nDesign trumps \"luxury\" 110% of the time. \n\nThe current Camry feels good inside and the hybrid gets 50mpg real world. If you just want a great sedan to drive around, it's hard to beat. \n\nWhat do you really want?",

I passed on it because even though my driver record was squeaky clean and I was at the time in my early 30s, I couldn't get an insurance quote for coverage that was anywhere South of $200 a month. Which is just insane. I now have a Corvette that - absolutely no joke - I pay $25 a month for full coverage on.\n\nCars like the Lexus you are speaking of will likely have similar insurance rates. Kids and younger people are going to flock to the Impreza/WRX, which jacks insurance up across the board. On the other hand they're not likely to own a Lexus-anything, which tends to keep insurance premiums for Lexus models more reasonable.",

After a conversation yesterday she's basically thrown out the idea of spending 25k on a car (impreza) and should just go for a lexus something for 50k because \"it won't ever break\" and generally has resell value.\n\nI really don't think that any of the new 2023 models out there today from any manufacturer are going to last 20 years.  Things like complex electronics, lack of redundant HVAC controls, CVTs, and direct injection engines won't stand the test of time in a car driven hard, even if it's well maintained.  I drive a Lincoon Town Car that turns 18 this year, and even with it being a very simple vehicle compared to modern cars, keeping it on the road and well-maintained is a labor of love at this point.\n\nTo your wife's point, something like a new Lexus ES will be more reliable in the long run than an Impreza, especially of you say you drive it hard.  Comes down to, spend $25k on a car that may give you a good 3-4 years trouble-free and be a money pit for another 5-7 before catastrophic failure, or spend $50k on a car that will probably be easy to own for 6-10 years then turn into a money pit.  FWIW, the 3.5 liter V6 used in several Lexus models is usually good for 250k-300k miles.",

          "text": "To answer the question directly... Get a Toyota.  They're just as reliable as Lexus as they're using a lot of the same parts.  I can take my Toyota into any Toyota or Lexus dealer to have maintenance and warranty services performed, it's the same guys with the same tools.  You may not get quite as many bells and whistles but you also won't pay a premium for the \"luxury\" brand.\n\nTo read behind the lines a little, are you sure the cost is going to be enough to warrant a new car?  If you want a new car, and are just using this as an excuse to push you over the \"justified\" line, well then so be it and enjoy your new car.  If not, how expensive of a brake job are you needing?  Even if it is $1,000 (which would be expensive even if you needed new pads, rotors, and calipers) you're still going to be money ahead compared to one or two payments on a new car.  Years ago I had an old Mazda that needed a $600 engine repair.  When I was paying for it, the cashier commented \"See, this is why I always drive new cars, I don't have to worry about expensive repairs.\"  I asked her how much her payments were, and she said they were $475.  I explained that I'd had that vehicle for 10 years, and this was the first repair outside of normal maintenance like brake pads and oil changes that are still needed on new cars.  Every two months she spends more in payments than I had in repairs in 10 years.  I don't think she ever really understood that she spent over $50K in vehicle payments in order to avoid $600 in repairs.\n\nLike I said, if you just want a new car, make yourself happy.  Just make sure you aren't kidding yourself that it will save you money by getting a new one compared to fixing the one you have, unless it's to the point that you're constantly having big repairs.",

          "text": "If you don’t want to pay to fix your current car it is time to go test driving.  Establish your parameters.  Establish your max price.  Remove $3k.  That will establish your purchase price plus warranty.  \n\nThen go to the dealerships for Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, and any other auto company you fancy.  VW is another good choice.  See the cars in your size and price range.  Get brochures.  \n\nThen go back and test drive on another day.  Let your body decide what you want.  That will make your wallet and your body happy.  \n\nYou may still run into markups for souped up small cars, like the civic S.  But by seeing a range you will get educated after a long hiatus.  \n\nMy Hyundai Tucson lasted me almost 18 years.  I started online looking for a replacement compact SUV 1 1/2 years and learned a lot in the process.  \n\nWhen my old car had multiple problems at once I was ready with my car and upgrades selection.  I decided to buy somewhat used because the car depreciation dropped the cost.  I was lucky I got a great vehicle before.  Time will tell if my current car will be problem free, but 9 months later I am happy.  \n\nThe main thing is if you want to change companies you need to get educated on what meets your criteria and what upgrades and electronics you want or will use.  New cars with internet connectivity come with extra monthly charges driving up the cost, and have frequent problems.\n\nActually, a used Lexus is not a bad choice, since they have a history of being problem free.  The small one is a NX200.  It is not highly upgraded like a larger Lexus because it is the entry level offering.  They are available coming off lease with warranty intact.  You might want to add Lexus to tour searches.",

This will come up in a future argument, I guarantee it.\n\nBigger picture, go with your initial plan and buy her a Lexus and you take the Civic.  The problem, in my opinion, with holding onto cars 10-20 years:\n\n1. Safety features: Automatic brakes, lane assist, collision avoidance, overall build quality, etc are all getting better and more sophisticated.  As someone who lives in Texas, you can't put a price on a car that could save your life.  My BMW was totaled by a driver trying to jump three lanes and I felt nothing; had I of been in my old Nissan... I doubt I would have been so fortunate.  My wife has a 2022 VW Tiguan, she was rear-ended by a Jeep that was going maybe 60-70 MPH while she was at a dead stop due to an accident.  Walked away with zero issues and the Tiguan absorbed that impact like it was nothing.  The older Jeep was totaled. \n2. Driving Experience: Most newer cars drive better.  I'm not sure if you test-drove a new Lexus, but the experience is going to be significantly better than your old Accent. Even jumping from my 2017 BMW to my 2023 Acura felt like going from the Flintstones to the Jetsons.\n3. Communication and GPS: Sure you can install aftermarket kits such as a hands-free set but Apple Car Play, etc are just things I can't live without at this point.  You wouldn't believe how nice it is to look at my front windshield's heads-up display for directions instead of fumbling with my phone, unlocking it, and navigating the app all while driving. (A process that isn't very safe....)\n\nNow, do you need a Lexus?  If you don't want to spend that kind of money, get something in the middle.  Either way, cars are getting bigger and faster, and speed limits are going up, if you can't justify it based on price, think about your safety.",

The base model Mazdas are even cheaper then the Impreza you’re looking at (but has the ability to be built into a proper luxury vehicle if you desire with the factory options). Personally, mazda pulled me away from VW, Toyota, Honda, Kia and Hyundai because the total package they offer is head and shoulders beyond the competition and has the same features and specs as a Audi A class, Benz A class or BMW 1/2 series while being significantly cheaper. If you have the ability to, test drive the mazda 3 sedan or the sport hatchback, as they compete directly with the vehicles you are seeking.",

While not a Luxury Brand, they are moving up market and their interiors are much better than Toyota and also have excellent reliability.\n\nTake the 15k to 20k that you save buying the Toyota and invest jt an Index or Mutual Fund for 20 to 30 years. \n\nThat 15k could become 55k after 20 years, or over 100k after 30 years (with compounding interest). \n\nI’m not trying for talk you out of buying what you want, just making a point that a Dollar saved today can turn into many Dollars tomorrow. But the Bottom Line Up Front is, if you don’t want to buy a Luxury car, then you shouldn’t! \n\nA general rule to follow when buying a vehicle is the 20/4/10 rule. 20% down — be able to pay 20% or more of the total purchase price up front. 4-year loan — be able to pay off the balance in 48 months or fewer. 10% of your income — your total monthly auto costs (including insurance, gas, maintenance, and car payments) should be 10% or less of your monthly income.\n\nYou guys have a High income, but that would probably be stretching it a bit to meet that rule with a Lexus, and not an issue with the Toyota or a Mazda.",

If you fixed those brakes, that's something you're not going to have to worry about for possibly 50k or more miles, I have a Silverado with 250k that has lots and lots of new parts, it's almost to the point of being a new truck, and I know everything on that truck like the back of my hand, I could drive it coast to coast and it would run like a top the entire time because of how well I maintained it.\n\nOne last thing to consider, new cars don't break as often, but when they do, expect to be paying 5-10 times the money for parts. Some of the fancy taillights or headlights on new cars can cost up to $4k (price them out.) On an older vehicle there is parts galore in the junkyards that can be acquired for next to NOTHING. in my experience the maintenance cost of a new car will be very close if not more to a well maintained used car, so using this as an excuse/ justification will lead you to buyers remorse.\n\nThe only time this changes for me is if I had an enormous amount of money that I had to dispose of quickly, because buying a new car is just as effective as lighting it on fire.",

So the Impreza would be my first choice, especially if you can get the RS version with the sport suspension and the bigger engine. The new one is a huge upgrade over the old one, it's actually quite inside too. It also handles surprisingly well, and has the advantage over the civic with the AWD. (And yes it's noticeable, the moment the road is wet or the tires are cold, the civic just spins until it finally can get power down. Not good when you're trying to merge in fast traffic here in Florida. \n\nThough if you want a larger car the Legacy is also a very nice car, and there will be a noticeable jump on the interior quality . If you want a luxury car that's cheap, the XT Touring is more than enough for me personally. \n\nIf you had to get a luxury vehicle, I'd look into a Genesis or even a Volvo.

Some plastic interior piece breaks? It's a junk yard part on a non-luxury car where you're basically paying the price of someone pulling it, but it's special-order and $$$ on a Lexus. Wheel curbed and it breaks a sensor or something like that? Lexus price. All maintenance and consumables will cost more including 93 octane gas.\n\nResale value shouldn't be a factor for your car if you intend to drive it into the ground. That being said, if she wants luxury features, quality, and prestige, she'll probably want to trade/sell it after 4-5 years to get all that stuff up-to-date. Then no worries about repair costs for a car you might intend to drive into the ground. But all of that will still be losing value, and you still have a car note after trading up.\n\nI'd get a new non-luxury car with all the options that are important for you. It'll be an nice upgrade from your Accent and Civic. Pay it off, save some extra, and see if anyone still has the luxury itch in a few years. If not, put the savings toward something more important to you guys.",

The maintenance plans pay for themselves several times over if you follow the schedule, and the warranty gives you peace of mind. Just don’t roll those into the financing, because that’s where you lose money.",

(no offense intended) Last year, we purchased a 2022 Hyundai Tucson. I did extensive research on it and many other comparable vehicles. This was the one that stood out & we LOVE it. That being said, a Lexus is just as susceptible to break down as any other car. The difference is that a Lexus will cost more to fix. But, that is only after the warranty expires. In that respect, most dealers/manufacturers are offering ONLY three year warranties on new vehicles. I also know that, luxury vehicles are more expensive to insure as well. I know you are in good shape financially but, that may change at any given moment. I know that you are in good shape financially but, for me practicality is always better. So my advice is this: DO YOUR RESEARCH. There are top of the line, CHEAPER brands. They are just as nice and hold their value over time. Best of luck and I hope this helps. Peace out.",

Size and boatiness or if going with a sports rigidity responsiveness in a sharp way or even sometimes softness of it's tuned for luxury. I would say do a list of 5 try out 5 cars at CarMax 15 mins each they usually don't care too much and get a feel for what you do and do not like. Reliability is one thing but you gotta remember when you buy new you're buying something more complicated so buy something you'll be happy with till for at least the warranty length and after that if you like it as long as nothing happens keep up that maintenance and you'll be golden.",

Just gotta maintain it and your fine. \n\nNewer Hyundai vehicles actually priced very well and come with 3 years of free maintenance and a very good warranty. As long as your getting new stuff off the lot you won't run into the insurance issues or the engine problems people are attributing to Kia and Hyundai as a brand (let's not be brand loyal/brand hateful blindly here we're not that dumb) \n\nThe Subaru is nice but also priced a little high. \nPersonally I'd be considering Mazda's 3 if you wanted something that you could feel had that 'pedigree' reliability like a Toyota or honda seeing as the vast majority of Mazda's parts are Toyota with a focus on the car being more exciting to drive which they do very well, and premium to a degree that honestly gets close to lexus. \nHyundai's Elantra/Kia's forte are similar sized cars to the civic, Mazda 3 and impreza and get that tasty free warranty and service. The interior and features these cars get for some reason is often nicer then larger cars they sell at a lower price. \nThere's also Volkswagen's Jetta, I honestly don't worry about VAG cars that much. I've had several and they'd run me well over 5-8 years of ownership, as long as you don't year the car up like a highschool driver and get it maintained on schedule your're fine, if anything the VW has really nice range on a small fuel tank and goes twice as long between oil changes per the dealer. \n\n\nHonestly, go around and see what finance deals you qualify for.

Now that you’ve talked her down from that a bit, the overall quality of high-trim non-luxury vehicles has gotten very good lately. Shop around, see what you like, but thinks like top trim Accords, some of the new Hyundais, VW, etc look very sharp and border on luxury without the price tag.\n\nEdit: you might want something bigger than this, but I’m a big fan of the new Integra. Acura fanboys don’t love it because it’s not a 2 door lightweight sports car like the original, but it’s essentially a dressed up Civic Si (which already has a very nicely finished interior for its price point).

My dad actually calculated it out and that car drove to the moon and 2x around it I think. I loved that car but sadly it got totaled in an accident. \nSo then I bought a used 2015 Acura tlx that happened to come with the sport and technology package for $12k (this was when corona first started tho and I bought it from a Toyota dealership so I think they just wanted it gone) but I love this car so so much. Over 150k miles on it and it is going strong af and it feels pretty luxurious.\nMy dads just like u, he’s driving a basic rav4. He could definitely afford a luxury car like even a bmw or Mercedes but he’s just always been the type to be happy with anything that takes him from point A to B and drives them into the grounddddd. And he doesn’t really care much about what car he drives, prefers to save or spend money on things like vacation. Plus the peace of mind of having a reliable vehicle is everything. \nI’d say reliability wise go for Honda or Toyota, or Acura or Lexus but I think Acura might be a bit more reliable I’m not sure. \nBut honestly at this point I can’t see myself driving anything other than another Acura (or a Toyota/Honda if Acura is out of my price range by the time I need a new car). Maybe look at a used Acura. It’ll be pricier now but could be a compromise bc it’ll last you a while and won’t be $50k",

I forget which one because honestly I'm not an SUV person. they build the same model. that is the Toyota variant of that in the same building. the Toyota parts can go on with much less strict quality control standards than the Lexus parts. they truly take a lot of pride in what they build and if I was in the market for a new car I would be going for one.",

Based on legendary Land Cruiser. \n\nThose are the 5 longest sold Lexus models and a good one will easily last beyond 200k miles before maintenance gets expensive. My GX is at about $5000-6000 total spent on repairs/ mostly maintenance at 180k miles.

Common issues are VVTI oil banjo crush washers leaking (not a big deal, easy to repair all but 1), drive pulleys being a bit tired north of 80k miles, easy repair. And sometimes water pumps start weeping in the weep hole around then, again easy repair with an Aisin OEM pump. \n\nThey do sometimes get corrosion between the block and the head gasket in very salt laden areas, and it’ll eat into the block surface until it leaks coolant. But it’ll trash the whole longblock while doing the eating. Not really a Toyota problem, more an all aluminum engine in heavy salt area problem. It’s not common common, but I know a Toyota tech in IL and he’s seen maybe a dozen 2GRs die this way. Given they tend to run forever if taken care of, it’s a notable number that die. Next most common is no oil changes and sludging engine up.",

That said, the well maintained part is important, if it hadn't been, it will have some problems soon. See if they have service records. If they don't, Carfax often has the service history, though not always, and it is often incomplete. Many shops report to Carfax when they did work, some don't. So, if it shows semi regular oil changes and other service, I wouldn't worry too much if some is missing (if they did regular oil changes for 2 years, then it shows 3 years with none, followed by regular oil changes again, they probably just temporarily changed to a shop that doesn't report).",

Still likely driving, cut someone a deal for $2k to drive it till death. Upkeep is relatively low. TLDR4 upvotes but math is decent. 115k is high 4 a Kia, or BMW, dodge etc that dies around 150-160k. Honda gets beat/neglected, still gets 250k. Toyotas maintained/driven often push >300k. Depending on year.\nI honestly think it's a little high myself, checked to confirm $10,5 is private party G but given you asked I'm gonna assume you aren't interested In doing that in which case yes it's a great deal.

Lexus is the equivalent of wallpaper paste, it’s kinda hard to fuck it up, but at the same time you are t going to be wowing yourself with how well the wallpaper sticks to the wall. If your goal is to have a simple functioning car that you don’t have to think about, A lexus is a good choice, and they are very comfortable typically and stupidly easy to take care of. Alongside this, I would bet that in today’s market, you will be hard-pressed to find something that is as reliable and as nice inside as an old Lexus can be.",

I don't even think that car has forward collision breaking.  \n\n\nYou got some good advice. I will also share my experience. The car is 12 years old. Yes Lexus IS arguably one of the best made cars on the planet from Toyota. You'll need to ensure it has maintenance records to show oil changes and other services. I would not be buying a car that old without a pre-inspection. I would pay the $300 from a reputable professional. You absolutely need to look under that car. I would never buy a car that all without looking under it. You will see a lot. I would work with a pre-inspection person to see if they can get that on a lift.. \n\nYes.  It's possible that it's just a really good car because it's been driven low mileage for that old. Highway miles and City miles are big difference. When you look at the records you should see where it was registered. Also if it's an salt state . The other thing to consider is it's a machine and you will have to maintain and repair it and Lexus parts are not cheap if you happen to need the genuine parts. \n\n\nThe other thing to consider is a lot of times when people sell cars they usually need tires brakes rotors pads that could be a couple thousand dollars easily. That's something that you should be able to easily see with a pre-inspection. I am not a fan of leasing. But as you mentioned you're a mom with kids you don't have time for the car to break down and would want the latest safety.\n\n I would definitely want forward collision blind spot monitoring and rear cross traffic alert at minimum. This is pretty much standard on any new car. Also these old cars are not rated as good for safety. It definitely doesn't have all the latest airbags like today. I view this car as a beautiful car for someone for a second car that just wants to own it and deal with the maintenance and cost. \n\nI am not a fan of leasing at all. However in your situation with two kids I would definitely get a car with the latest safety maximize my risk of having issues and costs. If you lease a car essentially you have no liability for any repairs and the chance of a repair happening is low. \n\nYou could spend $8,000 and get a car for 3 years. Yes it's renting a car but you have no risk very low chance of issues and everything is covered. You could buy the car out if you like it and own it out right and you could save. That's what I want to do. Hope this is helpful",

Despite everybody saying it’s baby miles for Lexus go Lexus and such, I want to highlight that if it has a turbocharged engine made by bmw, if I’m not mistaken, it has to be maintained as a bmw engine. My friend had an rx350, started having some problems with it as his rpm would fluctuate, and he’d have check engine light on the dash. He replaced injectors at about 70k miles, done something else, but ultimately sold the car. Think he needed to do the carbon cleaning as well but my point stands. And it’s the mileage where it’s going to be a good idea to take a look at many important parts of the engine: injectors, timing chain, all the seals, etc.",
