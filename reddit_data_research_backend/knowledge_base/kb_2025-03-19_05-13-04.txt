I like the idea of having a sleeper, but I'm not sure if this is worth the price they're asking. I'd mainly be concerned about availability of parts since I do \\* most \\* repairs myself.\n\nThoughts?\n\n[2001 Lexus LS 430](https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/2e1edd9e-9d54-49a0-8de6-8137c64552a2/?aff=atempest&CMP=atempest&utm_source=AutoTempest&utm_medium=TRP&utm_campaign=atempest)",

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have been on a wild obsession with Lexus’s lately and I have been considering getting one for a while. I currently drive a 2015 Honda Accord with 150k miles on it and it seems like it’s still going strong, however I’m slowly growing bored with it and would like something different. The ride quality, interior, and overall performance of the es330 and ls430 are attractive, especially the wood trim in the interior. My questions are:\n\n- Is it worth getting an older es330 or an ls430 or should I keep the car I have now?\n-Are parts still available or are they becoming scarce for both vehicles\n-Is the Ls430 worth the extra money and will it hold up to the test of time being almost 20+ year old car\n-Is it difficult to install aftermarket items\n\nI know these vehicles don’t come with Bluetooth and a backup camera like my Honda has but I’m willing to spend a little more money for a decent setup. \n\nWhile reliability and ride + interior quality is important to me I also dwell on the financial side of it. I would like good mpg and not have to buy premium fuel (which is something the Ls430 is going to need) but if it’s still relevant enough Im willing to make some sacrifices. \n\nIt’s something I’ve wanted for a while but I don’t want to screw myself over by buying a car that could potentially be difficult to repair and maintain.\n\nAll opinions are welcome please let me know what you guys think :)",

Make sure it has a timing belt change and fluid changes on the Carfax or service records for coolant and transmission at least once in the last 18-22 years. You should probably still drain/fill all the fluids regardless with a car that old which will add quite a bit of cost unless you can do the work yourself. Expect the rubber front end parts to need replacement due to age. Check for oil burning (white smoke, not steam) on a cold start. if you get a good one the repair maintenance cost shouldn't be too bad but if you get a bad one it can cost a lot. Same advice as above with an old ES330.",

      "selftext": "Hey r/whatcarshouldIbuy,\n\nI’m a passionate car enthusiast who’s recently moved to Alberta, Canada, and I’m eyeing a 2004-06 Lexus LS430 as my daily driver and first car here. My research and a constant push from raving YouTubers have piqued my interest in this luxury sedan, but I have no physical experience with it.\n\nI’d love to hear from fellow Redditors who have experience with the LS430, especially in Canadian conditions. Here are a few questions swirling in my head:\n\n* How does the LS430 fare as a daily driver?\n* Any specific maintenance concerns I should be aware of for a car of this age?\n* Considering Alberta’s wintery conditions, how does the LS430 handle snow and ice? Is it practical for winter driving with the right tires?\n* Are there any quirks or hidden issues I should watch out for?\n\nI’m eager to hear your insights, experiences, and any advice you have for a car enthusiast who’s new to Canada and navigating the used car market here. Let’s keep it witty and welcoming!\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

Not the best on gas. It feels bad to get 14ish mpg on premium gas driving around town. You get much better mileage on the highways. \n\nLots of things can break. When they're fixed with OE or high quality aftermarket parts ($$$) they're usually good for a long time. ClubLexus' LS430 forum is a good place to look. Also this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LS430/comments/iqr5pu/for\\_those\\_looking\\_to\\_buy\\_an\\_ls430/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LS430/comments/iqr5pu/for_those_looking_to_buy_an_ls430/)\n\nI live in Florida. IDK. It's RWD. Use the right tires and don't suck and others will probably hit you before you hit them.",
