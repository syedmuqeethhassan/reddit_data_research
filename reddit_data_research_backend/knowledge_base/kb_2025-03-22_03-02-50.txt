I like the idea of having a sleeper, but I'm not sure if this is worth the price they're asking. I'd mainly be concerned about availability of parts since I do \\* most \\* repairs myself.\n\nThoughts?\n\n[2001 Lexus LS 430](https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/2e1edd9e-9d54-49a0-8de6-8137c64552a2/?aff=atempest&CMP=atempest&utm_source=AutoTempest&utm_medium=TRP&utm_campaign=atempest)",

It's the right spec, the right style, the right number of doors at the right price. Then get a Carfax for it - your own, not one provided by the seller.\n\nIf the seller is willing, take the car for an afternoon to a mechanic for a pre-purchase inspection.\n\nBoth of those cost money, but less than the hassle of a timebomb in your driveway.\n\nIf everything comes out thumbs-up, great. You found the cherry! Enjoy your car.\n\nEdit: spelling",

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have been on a wild obsession with Lexus’s lately and I have been considering getting one for a while. I currently drive a 2015 Honda Accord with 150k miles on it and it seems like it’s still going strong, however I’m slowly growing bored with it and would like something different. The ride quality, interior, and overall performance of the es330 and ls430 are attractive, especially the wood trim in the interior. My questions are:\n\n- Is it worth getting an older es330 or an ls430 or should I keep the car I have now?\n-Are parts still available or are they becoming scarce for both vehicles\n-Is the Ls430 worth the extra money and will it hold up to the test of time being almost 20+ year old car\n-Is it difficult to install aftermarket items\n\nI know these vehicles don’t come with Bluetooth and a backup camera like my Honda has but I’m willing to spend a little more money for a decent setup. \n\nWhile reliability and ride + interior quality is important to me I also dwell on the financial side of it. I would like good mpg and not have to buy premium fuel (which is something the Ls430 is going to need) but if it’s still relevant enough Im willing to make some sacrifices. \n\nIt’s something I’ve wanted for a while but I don’t want to screw myself over by buying a car that could potentially be difficult to repair and maintain.\n\nAll opinions are welcome please let me know what you guys think :)",

          "text": "If it's a garaged well maintained example, an older LS430 is not a bad choice. They do have issues with the interior if it's left out in the sun instead of a garage like any car. Make sure it has a timing belt change and fluid changes on the Carfax or service records for coolant and transmission at least once in the last 18-22 years. You should probably still drain/fill all the fluids regardless with a car that old which will add quite a bit of cost unless you can do the work yourself. Expect the rubber front end parts to need replacement due to age. Check for oil burning (white smoke, not steam) on a cold start. if you get a good one the repair maintenance cost shouldn't be too bad but if you get a bad one it can cost a lot. Same advice as above with an old ES330.",
